matlab_rosbag_plot
==================

uses the https://github.com/bcharrow/matlab_rosbag code

I use this one for reading in the data for testing purposes from the IMU.

The first plot shows the acceleration (free acceleration in this case - earth acceleration is already substracted) 
The second one the computed position. (which is quite far out unless its straigth after turnign the device on)
